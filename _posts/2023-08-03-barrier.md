title: "Linux and Windows with the same keyboard and mouse"
classes: wide
---

I have recently refurbished an old computer I had at my parents place and decided it was time to have my first Linux physical machine and not just a virtual machine. However, I had to solve the problem of having only a single keyboard and mouse at home and avoid the hassle of unplugging and connecting the peripherals every time I want to work in Linux.

Luckily, a friend recommended me [barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) (shout out to VÃ­ctor), so I took the challenge to set it up at home. My desk at home consists of:

* A Windows 10 Laptop
* An Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) PC
* Two screens
* One mouse
* One keyboard

After reading **barrier's** documentation it became clear that it has a server-client architecture. Since I mainly work with my laptop, I chose to make this the server and make the Linux PC the client. This also meant that I had to configure both machines to have static IPs. I checked my router configuration:

* Network range: 192.168.1.0/24
* DHCP range: 192.168.1.125-192.168.1.254
* Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Good, no need to change the router to make some IPs available, part of the network range is not covered by DHCP. I configured both machines as follows:

* Laptop (the server): 192.168.1.10
* Ubuntu (the client): 192.168.1.11

I installed the last available version of **barrier** on both systems. Luckily, **barrier** provides a `.exe` on its release page on Github: https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/releases/tag/v2.4.0, so that covers Windows. As for Ubuntu, as easy as:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install barrier
```

Now that **barrier** is installed on both machines, it is time to configure it.

## Windows

When **barrier** is started for the first time, it let's you choose between server an client. I chose server. On the main panel of **barrier** the preferred settings are selected by default. All I had to do was making sure that the `Server` dialog box was selected.

Then, after clicking on the `Configure Server` button, the following window pops up:

![server-config-2](https://pablohiro.github.io/page/assets/images/barrier-2.png)

I double clicked on the right of my main display, as I wanted to have Ubuntu displayed on my screen on the right, and named this client with the same hostname my Ubuntu machine has: `workstation`. Once this is done, and the **barrier** server is up and running, we are done with Windows.

## Linux

For Linux, I wanted to make the client start as a system service. Easiest way to set this up is to manually configure **barrier**, test it works and then save the command in a service file. In my case:

![client-config-1](https://pablohiro.github.io/page/assets/images/barrier-3.png)

```
$ ps aux | grep barrierc
user   12128  2.5  0.0  96128  7840 ?        Sl   23:20   0:03 /usr/bin/barrierc -f --no-tray --debug INFO --name workstation --disable-crypto --log /var/log/barrier.log [192.168.1.10]:24800
user   12486  0.0  0.0  17868  2540 pts/5    S+   23:23   0:00 grep --color=auto barrierc
```

Notice the flag `--disable-crypto`. For simplicity purposes, I disabled SSL as I have separate WIFI network for guests ;)

I checked as well the command line options listed [here](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/wiki/Command-Line), and added `--restart` to the service definition.

I created the systemd service definition:

```
$ sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/barrier.service
$ cat /etc/systemd/system/barrier.service
[Unit]
Description=Barrier mouse/keyboard share
Requires=display-manager.service
After=display-manager.service
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/barrierc -f --no-tray --debug INFO --name workstation --disable-crypto --restart --log /var/log/barrier.log [192.168.1.10]:24800
Restart=always
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

And configured it so it boots on startup:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable barrier
sudo systemctl start barrier
```

And that's it, setup done.

## Result
