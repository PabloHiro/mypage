I have worked as a consultant since 2018 for multiple customers in different fields such as Legal, Energy, Commerce, Financial and Space.

This has given me the chance to work in a large variety of projects and learn the skills to help teams implement and operate with success automated software development cycles, software infrastructure management and migrations to cloud, promoting a DevOps culture along the way.

I am a firm believer that technology is a key part in our development as a better (global) society. I hope to help others by sharing the most interesting bits of what I have learned through my professional life.
